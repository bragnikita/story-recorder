This project is SPA web interface for my personal game scripts translations publishing website. 

[Here](https://magireco-story.netlify.com/c/5d748c4fe37d633881e2270c) is an example of translation of one episode of the Main Story of the popular mobile game "Magia Record" from Japanese to Russian.



The main purpose of this website is providing convinient UI for typing and formatting of dialog-based stories and immediate deliver the story updates in public access.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I'm using React 16(love Hooks) and Mobx for the application state management. Express and MongoDB are being used on the backend. I'm also using Ansible for the EC2 deployment of the server and use Nelify hosting for the front-end. nginx + Let's Encrypt are using for secured connection to the backend.
